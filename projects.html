<div align="justify" vertical-align="top" class="BodyText"><p><b class="BoldBodyText">GREENPORT International Airport and Technology Center</b> | GREENPORT encompasses 4,914 acres and incorporating:  • GREENPORT International Airport (GIA), a highly-secured privately owned and operated, state-of-the-art “green” airport to be developed to provide the currently unmet needs and the record growth of the Central Texas market for larger business, private and charter aircraft. GIA will also finally deliver the central Texas (Austin) region’s first emergency reliever airport capable of providing the missing air transportation safety, capacity, support and aviation and aircraft services that are not currently available in the region; and • GREENPORT International Technology Center (GITC), to be developed on an environmentally sustainable, highly-secure, corporate campus. It will primarily serve the technology, data-center, green business segments, military and government agencies with high-security requirements. The adjoining New Republic Studios will join the GREENPORT project bringing their existing movie, film, television and entertainment production campus into GREENPORT’s highly-secured service areas. NRS announced major expansion plans that potentially include other internationally known industry icon studios desiring to locate on the planned expanded 2,000-acre campus. GREENPORT’s economic impact will be enormous. Ray Perryman, a world-renown economist estimates in its first 13 years of operation, GREENPORT will create more than 325,000 job years (one full-time job for one year), 40,000 new permanent jobs and $36 billion of gross product.  Location GREENPORT is located only 17 miles from Austin's CBD, nine miles from Texas Highway 130, seven miles from Texas Highway 71, and 10 miles from U.S. Highway 290. The site features two miles of frontage on the Colorado River.  The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration ("FAA"), concluded the GREENPORT site ideal for an airport based on location, topography, and soil conditions.  GIA is 10 miles from Austin Bergstrom International Airport ("ABIA"), and its parallel airspace distance and air traffic complement ABIA's. GREENPORT International Airport solves a 40-year-old problem of inadequate general aviation infrastructure in Central Texas while fulfilling an urgent need for an emergency reliever airport for ABIA.   GREENPORT International Airport will be the only airport in Central Texas, other than ABIA, to meet all FAA and commercial aircraft insurance requirements necessary to accommodate larger business jets, corporate, charter and business fleet aircraft.  The current existing aviation infrastructure in Central Texas is deficient amid record regional population and business growth. The area population has grown 70% from 2000 to 2.1 million persons, and along with it demand for both commercial and general aviation capacity. According to the ABIA's Master Plan, the airport was planned for 11 million commercial air passengers annually, a level it reached in 2014. In March 2019, ABIA completed its 9-new international gates terminal expansion. ABIA now has the capacity to handle 15 million passengers and achieved final total build out of Terminal 1. This expanded capacity was already surpassed before the new gates had opened as the ABIA 2018 actual passenger counts exceeded 15.8 million.   The Austin City Council approved and funded the new 2040 Master Plan expansion with the planned phased construction of a new south Terminal 2 to duplicate the existing north Terminal. With actual airport passenger growth running from 8.5-10+% annually (fastest growing major airport in the U.S.) the 2040 plan is actually a 2030 plan to accommodate the expected 32+m passengers per year. Further expansion to achieve a maximum of 60-70m passengers requires extreme airside densities and general aviation constraints. The physical limitations of ABIA’s limited airport site area (that cannot be expanded) is unable to handle the total aggregated takeoff and landings for the commercial air passenger and scheduled air cargo carriers, the National Guard, Army and Marine Reserves, the State of Texas Aircraft and General Aviation. ABIA has provided a letter of support for GREENPORT International Airport and would prefer to redirect all General Aviation there but, FAA funding requirements mandate ABIA must continue to provide some level of General Aviation service. ABIA has frozen the land area for General Aviation which is now 95% built out and no further expansion for General Aviation is planned, which defaults that growth to GIA. Current and future demand from the business jet segment should default to GREENPORT, without competition, because the three small General Aviation airports do not meet and cannot be modified or expanded to meet all the requirements of the FAA, commercial insurance companies or specified aircraft operational requirements to service the higher performance, business, corporate, charter and private aircraft owner/operator needs.   Green, Private, Independently Sustainable GREENPORT provides a new “GREEN” U.S. International Port of Entry/Exit demonstrating private microgrids that produce revenue from the provision of essential services for on-site energy, data/communications, security, water & wastewater resources, and Net-zero waste management capabilities.  GREENPORT will provide an independent off-grid sustainable and environmentally-advanced business campus for both on-airport and off-airport customers. GREENPORT’s private ownership of the essential services is designed to create a competitive advantage over the publicly available grids and municipal services. Quality controls, security, sustainability, and certainty of services delivery cannot be guaranteed or controlled relying on public utility grids. GREENPORT will interconnect, with security precautions, to the outside grids for redundancy and opportunistic sales of excess energy and other resources. GREENPORT’s real estate model will leverage lower cost energy that can be locked in for terms matching leasehold agreements to attract high taxable value data centers, government agencies, defense contractors, the U.S. Army Futures Command and supporting businesses.   GREENPORT enjoys a 75% share of all Bastrop County property, business property, sales tax and hotel taxes collected within the boundaries of GREENPORT for 30 years. The property tax reimbursement can provide a source for economic development inducements to recruit desirable high-tax value business and high energy and communications consumers.  Planned and partnered with “Best in Class” companies, expert in their fields, GREENPORT will develop separate businesses that are privately owned and controlled generating and distributing onsite retail/wholesale energy within a microgrid to service its “captive customer market”. The microgrid will demonstrate a portfolio of diversified and distributed generations of lower-cost, sustainable, renewable green and clean energy generated on site that will be supplemented with energy storage. The total energy capabilities provide a secured, EMP-protected microgrid designed to deliver military and government standards for resiliency, sustainability and off-grid independence, including thermal heating and cooling services.   Multiple points of independent fiber and dark fiber connectivity is planned and will be funded, developed and operated privately in a similar manner with “Best in Class” corporate partner/s.  Fiber and microwave-based data/communications microgrid will be deployed to serve GREENPORT’s “captive customer market”. Revenue sharing agreements will allow GREENPORT customers access to any 3rd party services provider via the GREENPORT secured infrastructure networks.     Security services will be provided by a “Best in Class” security company to address total project needs and individual requirements for the energy and communications businesses and those of any customers at GREENPORT. Tiers of subscription services will be available ranging from aviation asset and client protections, assets, systems, comprehensive physical, cybersecurity or counterterrorism capabilities will be available.   Onsite rainwater harvesting and storage in addition to reuse and abundant groundwater resources can provide GREENPORT with independent and sustainable water supply resources. Wastewater reuse capabilities will be deployed.   Advance waste management practices that incorporate green sustainable businesses that require municipal waste streams for their product manufacturing and production and energy generation resulting in 100% consumption and reuse of all MSW generated at GREENPORT and Bastrop County. Valuable resources are created in an environmentally compatible manner. GREENPORT will offer companies a sustainable ecological and environmental campus for demonstrating proof-of-concept green systems, technologies, products and services.    GREENPORT will privately build, own and operate the extension of Texas Highway FM 1704 thru the project constructing a short bridge over the Colorado River to connect with North Pope Bend Road. This extension provides a new economic development corridor along FM 1704 and interconnects U.S. Highway 290 East with Texas Highway 71 the two designated disaster relief highways between Austin and Houston. With private development and ownership emergency closure of the road and bridge for security purposes can be instantly managed and of the is no requirement to provide public utility easements within the project’s boundaries and access to its customer base. This will enable Central Texas Airport Holdings to control GREENPORT’s smart-grid network, which is secure, high-quality and reliable. Such security features will be instrumental in attracting data centers and government agencies dealing with classified, or otherwise highly sensitive information and operations.    Project Planning, Approvals & Permits GREENPORT is a planned, shovel-ready, "proof-of-concept" project for leading-edge companies with global technologies. Project design and valuation work has been conducted by leading aviation and development experts. Fatal-flaw analyses are complete, major entitlements secured and public/private reimbursement agreements in place.  Ownership will privately regulate all business- and development-related activities in the project. No FAA approval and no TSA operations oversight are required. Building permits aren't required; only administrative approval of a site-development permit, which is limited to showing access to public roads and availability of utilities. protections, assets, systems, comprehensive physical, cybersecurity or counterterrorism capabilities will be available.

<div align="justify" vertical-align="top" class="BodyText"><p><b class="BoldBodyText">111 Congress Tower - High-rise Office & New â€œGatewayâ€� to Downtown Austin</b> | C&A privately planned and executed the land assemblage, redevelopment and revitalization of the new â€œGatewayâ€� to downtown Austin and the Texas State Capital. Disgusted with the unsightly appearance and inappropriate land uses on five square blocks, C&A privately targeted this area as its redevelopment zone, encompassing Congress Avenue, what was then Town Lake and 1st Street, Brazos, San Jacinto and Trinity Streets. C&A assembled the ownership or controlling interest in each of those blocks for its new gateway redevelopment. C&Aâ€™s vision was to replace liquor stores, seedy bars, tire stores, gas station, manufacturing business, dilapidated buildings vagrants sleeping on the sidewalks and alleyways, along with landmark businesses and responsible property owners such as the famous Mattâ€™s El Rancho restaurant, Salvation Army, University of Texas, the Thompson and Cherico families with four new highrise office and two hotel properties. The existing property owners all agreed to assist in the effort through the sale or relocation of their respective properties to Carpenter & Assocites to allow this important redevelopment to occur. C&A privately developed new design standards and â€œwedding cakeâ€� ordinance that would allow alley closures and taller buildings as a tradeoff for self-imposing building setbacks from Congress Avenue in order to open the view corridor to the State Capital and providing lushly landscaped plazas along Congress and First Street, full sized trees and waterfalls or art features. C&A recruited experienced highrise and hotel developers from Dallas to participate in this major $350,000,000 overhaul of downtown Austin. C&A and The Vantage Companies joint-ventured the development/ownership of the centerpiece to this master-project - the 30-story 111 Congress Tower, with 510,000 square feet of luxury office and 225,000 square foot retail parking garage. Lincoln Properties acquired the block on the west side of Congress from C&A and developed the other cornerstone for Congress Avenue, the 100 Congress Tower. John Carpenter III of Southland Financial and Las Colinas of Dallas acquired the two blocks along 1st Street fronting Town Lake and developed the San Jacinto Tower and Four Seasons Hotel project. The City of Austin and its taxpayers gained a major new tax base and economic development stimulator that continues to profit the community today.</p><br></div></td></tr>

The Northeast Association was established to conduct master-planning for economic and infrastructure development for this regionâ€™s future network of roadways water, sewer & stormwater drainage dry utility services, public parks, and successful major industry recruitment (new Regional U.S. Post Office, Applied Materials, UPS, Samsung, etc). The NEAâ€™s non-profit operations were supported by private capital funding through annual membership dues by area property owners, industries, businesses, and area residents. Other NEA Board and Ex-Officio members included designated representatives from each of the areaâ€™s city councils (Austin, Pflugerville, Manor and Elgin), area school district Superintendents, 2-area Travis County Commissioners, and the area State Representatives and State Senator. The City of Austin adopted a Resolution on August 22, 1985 expressing its appreciation and encouragement for the NEAâ€™s efforts in the Cityâ€™s goals for comprehensive planning for this region east of Austin.  The success of the NEA was a factor resulting in the formation of the Greater Austin Area Chamber of Commerce with local area councils to represent their respective area interests.</p></div></td></tr>

He has assisted in obtaining federal, state and private grants to energize the redevelopment of underemployed and/or impoverished communities.  Just 9-miles north of Austin, the City of Manor was a primary focus for redevelopment and revitalization efforts as it adjoined over 4,000+ acres of he owned development land. One of the nationâ€™s largest development companies desired to partner with the Carpenter family interests in building a new master-planned residential based community and redevelop portions of Manor. The City of Austinâ€™s 7+ year condemnation effort to relocate its municipal airport to that area interrupted and held up those plans after they had already privately constructed the regionâ€™s first potable municipal water well fields and 8.5 miles of storage and transmission utility infrastructure. From 1984 until 1991 development plans were frozen. In 1991, Austin residents and City Council finally voted to halt its Manor condemnation and move its airport to Bergstrom Air Force Base. Today, ShadowGlen golf course community and numerous other residential developments have risen out of that extreme abuse of condemnation authority. The availability of the privately developed potable water supply and utility infrastructure resulted in the City of Manorâ€™s incredible population growth.

<div align="justify" vertical-align="top" class="BodyText"><p><b class="BoldBodyText">1985 Texas Legislative Session</b> | The assemblage of over 4,000-acres in northeast Travis County, beginning in 1981, required the independent exploration, development and operation of private municipal water, wastewater and storm water drainage facilities.  This undertaking was completed in 1984 and the City of Manor was provided with its first publicly approved municipal supplies of water without any capital investment from the city. This endeavor provided the northeast Travis County sector with its first municipal supplies of urban-level utility services though private capital investment initiatives.  The advent of the areaâ€™s first successful private utility development brought rural water supply companies and the City of Austin into competition over service area boundaries.  Jim sought legislative assistance to level the playing field and amend portions of the Texas Water Code to enable the creation of Regional Planning and Implementation Agencies.  These quasi public/private ventures allowed municipal entities to provide sponsorship for a regional utility service plan, to establish service boundary controls, and the surrender of service areas of rural water companies that could not also provide wastewater.  This legislation enabled the municipalities, utility districts and development interests the opportunity to bond together under regional utility agreements to provide comprehensively planned urban levels of services in rural areas.</p></div></td></tr>

<div align="justify" vertical-align="top" class="BodyText"><p><b class="BoldBodyText">1995 Texas Legislative Session</b> | With the leadership of Senator Gonzalo Barrientos, Jim assisted in the effort to regain property rights and restore land values for landowners in the Manor, Texas region. Legislation was drafted, introduced, lobbied by Jim, and passed in the 1995 Texas Legislative Session that allowed relief for private property owners that were adversely impacted by the City of Austinâ€™s failed 7-year long condemnation actions against thousands of acres near Manor. Austin used arbitrary strip extensions of its city limits in order to extend its Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction an additional 5-miles to claim control over Northeast Travis County. The intent was to adversely impact area landowners by imposing regulatory controls over their property, limiting property ownersâ€™ land uses and development options, in order to constrain the values prior to initiating condemnation. Over 400 property owners, including the Carpenter family holdings, were trapped by Austinâ€™s imminent domain proceedings for more than seven years extending into the nationâ€™s 1980â€™s Banking and Savings and Loan crisis. As lenders were closed or taken over by the FDIC or RTC, loans canceled, mortgages were called and large numbers of bankruptcies, foreclosures, and evictions were caused in the Manor area because these properties could not be developed, refinanced, sold, or leased because of Austinâ€™s pending condemnation.  Jim assisted in drafting and lobbying for Senate Bill 1397 that was passed by near unanimous approval of the Texas Legislature and signed by then Governor George Bush. He had earlier obtained executed powers of attorney from more than 400 of the areaâ€™s 413 affected property owners to represent their property and interests before the Texas Legislature and subsequently negotiate their legislatively forced release from the city of Austinâ€™s ETJ.  Jim negotiated a release of Austinâ€™s regulatory control from the Legislatureâ€™s mandated 9,000Â±acre area to include nearly 20,000 acres of Northeast Travis County.  Senator Barrientos and Representative Dawnna Dukes provided crucial leadership that led to passage of SB 1397 and the exceptional growth and new job opportunities that arose in Manor, Texas and northeast of Austin.</p>
