Disgusted with the unsightly appearance and inappropriate land uses on five square blocks, C&A privately targeted this area as its redevelopment zone, encompassing Congress Avenue, what was then Town Lake and 1st Street, Brazos, San Jacinto and Trinity Streets. C&A assembled the ownership or controlling interest in each of those blocks for its new gateway redevelopment. C&Aâ€™s vision was to replace liquor stores, seedy bars, tire stores, gas station, manufacturing business, dilapidated buildings vagrants sleeping on the sidewalks and alleyways, along with landmark businesses and responsible property owners such as the famous Mattâ€™s El Rancho restaurant, Salvation Army, University of Texas, the Thompson and Cherico families with four new highrise office and two hotel properties. The existing property owners all agreed to assist in the effort through the sale or relocation of their respective properties to Carpenter & Assocites to allow this important redevelopment to occur. C&A privately developed new design standards and â€œwedding cakeâ€� ordinance that would allow alley closures and taller buildings as a tradeoff for self-imposing building setbacks from Congress Avenue in order to open the view corridor to the State Capital and providing lushly landscaped plazas along Congress and First Street, full sized trees and waterfalls or art features. C&A recruited experienced highrise and hotel developers from Dallas to participate in this major $350,000,000 overhaul of downtown Austin. C&A and The Vantage Companies joint-ventured the development/ownership of the centerpiece to this master-project - the 30-story 111 Congress Tower, with 510,000 square feet of luxury office and 225,000 square foot retail parking garage. Lincoln Properties acquired the block on the west side of Congress from C&A and developed the other cornerstone for Congress Avenue, the 100 Congress Tower. John Carpenter III of Southland Financial and Las Colinas of Dallas acquired the two blocks along 1st Street fronting Town Lake and developed the San Jacinto Tower and Four Seasons Hotel project. The City of Austin and its taxpayers gained a major new tax base and economic development stimulator that continues to profit the community today.</p><br></div></td></tr>

This project uniquely captured effective market control in one of the best demographic markets in the Austin Metro-area.

A privately operated U.S. Postal Office and FedEx/UPS shipping center business was added, and is operated in the leasing office by the existing project management and presently serves over 7,000 customers per month. With the addition of this high-traffic feature SCS achieved 100% occupancy within months and constantly remained at or near that occupancy until the next phase expansion. A second, 4-story, 62,325 sq.ft. climate-controlled building was completed as of March, 2012 and leased to 100% within 15 months.

<div align="justify" vertical-align="top" class="BodyText"><p><b class="BoldBodyText">Community Redevelopment</b> | Since the early 1980â€™s Jim has assisted communities with regional and local community master-planning, establishment of or changes to city ordinances, building codes and the establishment of development incentives to attract and retain private investment and development capital. He has assisted in obtaining federal, state and private grants to energize the redevelopment of underemployed and/or impoverished communities.  Just 9-miles north of Austin, the City of Manor was a primary focus for redevelopment and revitalization efforts as it adjoined over 4,000+ acres of he owned development land. One of the nationâ€™s largest development companies desired to partner with the Carpenter family interests in building a new master-planned residential based community and redevelop portions of Manor. The City of Austinâ€™s 7+ year condemnation effort to relocate its municipal airport to that area interrupted and held up those plans after they had already privately constructed the regionâ€™s first potable municipal water well fields and 8.5 miles of storage and transmission utility infrastructure. From 1984 until 1991 development plans were frozen. In 1991, Austin residents and City Council finally voted to halt its Manor condemnation and move its airport to Bergstrom Air Force Base. Today, ShadowGlen golf course community and numerous other residential developments have risen out of that extreme abuse of condemnation authority. The availability of the privately developed potable water supply and utility infrastructure resulted in the City of Manorâ€™s incredible population growth.

<div align="justify" vertical-align="top" class="BodyText"><p><b class="BoldBodyText">1985 Texas Legislative Session</b> | The assemblage of over 4,000-acres in northeast Travis County, beginning in 1981, required the independent exploration, development and operation of private municipal water, wastewater and storm water drainage facilities.  This undertaking was completed in 1984 and the City of Manor was provided with its first publicly approved municipal supplies of water without any capital investment from the city. This endeavor provided the northeast Travis County sector with its first municipal supplies of urban-level utility services though private capital investment initiatives.  The advent of the areaâ€™s first successful private utility development brought rural water supply companies and the City of Austin into competition over service area boundaries.  Jim sought legislative assistance to level the playing field and amend portions of the Texas Water Code to enable the creation of Regional Planning and Implementation Agencies.  These quasi public/private ventures allowed municipal entities to provide sponsorship for a regional utility service plan, to establish service boundary controls, and the surrender of service areas of rural water companies that could not also provide wastewater.  This legislation enabled the municipalities, utility districts and development interests the opportunity to bond together under regional utility agreements to provide comprehensively planned urban levels of services in rural areas.</p></div></td></tr>

<div align="justify" vertical-align="top" class="BodyText"><p><b class="BoldBodyText">1995 Texas Legislative Session</b> | With the leadership of Senator Gonzalo Barrientos, Jim assisted in the effort to regain property rights and restore land values for landowners in the Manor, Texas region. Legislation was drafted, introduced, lobbied by Jim, and passed in the 1995 Texas Legislative Session that allowed relief for private property owners that were adversely impacted by the City of Austinâ€™s failed 7-year long condemnation actions against thousands of acres near Manor. Austin used arbitrary strip extensions of its city limits in order to extend its Extra-Territorial Jurisdiction an additional 5-miles to claim control over Northeast Travis County. The intent was to adversely impact area landowners by imposing regulatory controls over their property, limiting property ownersâ€™ land uses and development options, in order to constrain the values prior to initiating condemnation. Over 400 property owners, including the Carpenter family holdings, were trapped by Austinâ€™s imminent domain proceedings for more than seven years extending into the nationâ€™s 1980â€™s Banking and Savings and Loan crisis. As lenders were closed or taken over by the FDIC or RTC, loans canceled, mortgages were called and large numbers of bankruptcies, foreclosures, and evictions were caused in the Manor area because these properties could not be developed, refinanced, sold, or leased because of Austinâ€™s pending condemnation.  Jim assisted in drafting and lobbying for Senate Bill 1397 that was passed by near unanimous approval of the Texas Legislature and signed by then Governor George Bush. He had earlier obtained executed powers of attorney from more than 400 of the areaâ€™s 413 affected property owners to represent their property and interests before the Texas Legislature and subsequently negotiate their legislatively forced release from the city of Austinâ€™s ETJ.  Jim negotiated a release of Austinâ€™s regulatory control from the Legislatureâ€™s mandated 9,000Â±acre area to include nearly 20,000 acres of Northeast Travis County.  Senator Barrientos and Representative Dawnna Dukes provided crucial leadership that led to passage of SB 1397 and the exceptional growth and new job opportunities that arose in Manor, Texas and northeast of Austin.</p>
